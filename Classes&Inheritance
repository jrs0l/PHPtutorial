In this section we will be going over classes in PHP.

In the example below we have class file called fruit.

<?php
class Fruit {
  // Properties
  public $name;
  public $color;

  // Methods
  function set_name($name) {
    $this->name = $name;
  }
  function get_name() {
    return $this->name;
  }
}

$apple = new Fruit();

$banana = new Fruit();
$apple->set_name('Apple');
$banana->set_name('Banana');

echo $apple->get_name();
echo "<br>";
echo $banana->get_name();
?>

After this file is ran in your local server, you will get the output "Apple, Banana"
