The name of the language I will be going over is PHP. PHP is also known as Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP was created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.
It was originally created in a non-released version to keep track of who was looking at Rasmus Lerdorfs’ online resume. It was known prior in the early stage
as the “Personal Home Page Tools”. It then grew from being a guestbook, counter, and a few other tricks to being revamped into PHP/FI
(from another package that Lerdorf had previously written which interpreted html form data. Lerdorf combined both of them and added mSQL
support and that is how PHP was born. PHP is used significantly for supporting databases. However, it also can be used for collecting data,
generating dynamic page content, or sending and receiving cookies. It also has support for talking to other services using internet protocols.
I will use resources such W3 Schools, Youtube, other reputable educational sites to further the research for my tutorial on PHP.
